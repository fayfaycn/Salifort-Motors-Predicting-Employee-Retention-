Salifort Motors: Predicting Employee Retention
Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone Project

Project Overview
This project aims to help the HR department at Salifort Motors reduce employee turnover. By analyzing historical employee data, I developed a predictive model to identify high-risk employees and the key drivers of attrition.

Business Challenge
Salifort Motors' leadership wants to understand why employees are leaving and how to improve retention. The primary question is: Can we predict whether an employee will leave based on their departmental data and work habits?

Technical Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA), Scikit-learn (Machine Learning), XGBoost.

Framework: PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute).

Key Insights & Results
The "Overworked" Threshold: Employees working more than 200 hours per month or assigned to more than 5 projects showed a significantly higher probability of leaving.

Model Performance: The Random Forest model achieved an F1-score of [Insert your score, e.g., 0.94], outperforming the Logistic Regression model in predicting the "left" class.

Top Predictors: Satisfaction level, tenure (specifically at 4 years), and average monthly hours were the strongest predictors of turnover.

Actionable Recommendations
Cap Project Loads: Limit the number of projects per employee to prevent burnout.

Reward Tenure: Investigate why 4-year employees are dissatisfied and consider retention bonuses or promotions at this milestone.

Adjust Overtime Policies: Re-evaluate the work culture regarding long hours and ensure high evaluation scores are not tied solely to excessive overtime.
